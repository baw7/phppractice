	<p><h1><b>All About Brianna!</b></h1> <hr> 
<p>My name is Brianna Wong. I am from East Orange, New Jersey, a town about 30 minutes away from New York City.
<p>I am in the MS in Business and Information Systems Program. I am hoping to broaden my horizons in terms of courses, in order to learn things that are different from what I learned in my undergraduate career. Professionally, I am hoping to go into data management/information security. <br>I have aided in website design before, first in high school and then for a few undergraduate courses. </p>
